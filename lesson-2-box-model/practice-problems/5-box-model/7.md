Given our solution to the previous question, what will happen if we put the
article tags on separate lines?

```html
<section>
  <article>content</article>
  <article>more content</article>
</section>
```

I don't think adding that white space into the html will make a difference, and
the styling from the CSS will be applied the same no matter what.

This is wrong! The browser will interpret the new line as a single character of
white space, and will place that in between the `inline-block` elements. This
means that we would need extra width of the container element to accommodate
the two `article`s.
