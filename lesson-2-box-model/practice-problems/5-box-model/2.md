Given the code below, what is the minimum width and height (in pixels) that the
div needs to entirely contain the section element (including its margins)? How
does this differ from the result of the previous practice problem?

```hmtl 
<div>
  <section>content</section>
</div>
```

```css 
div {
  background-color: lightgray;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: inline-block;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

section {
  border: 4px solid red;
  box-sizing: content-box;
  display: block;
  height: 300px;
  margin: 20px 19px 10px 11px;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

The div would need:
Height: (2 + 8 + 300 + 20 + 10 + 20) = 360
Width: (2 + 8  + 19 + 11 + 40 + 500) = 580

The numbers are the same as the last problem. The only difference is that the
div is now an `inline-block` element, but that does not change the sizing
needed. Also, since the `img` element from the previous problem is an
`inline-block`, other elements could appear next to it. In contrast, the
`section` element from this problem is  `block` element, meaning it will take
up the entire row to itself.
