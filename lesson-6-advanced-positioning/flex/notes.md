* The header should take up the top ~10% of the entire viewport. The text
  should be centered within it
* The nav bar should be laid out horizontally, with each element taking up an
  equal portion 
* The main section should be directly under the nav, taking the width of the
  viewport. There should be three items which appear next to each other, with
  the asides taking 1/4 of the width and the article taking up 1/2
* Similarly, the footer should be under the main section and the two items
  inside of it should appear next to each other.
