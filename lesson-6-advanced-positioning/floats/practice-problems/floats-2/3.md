Why is the orange container now narrower than the blue? How can you keep the
orange box floated but take on the same width as the blue?

The orange container is more narrow than the blue because it will only be as
wide as necessary to fit all of its content. We can add a `width: 100%;` to
make it take up the rest of the horizontal space in its parent element.
