Ideally, you want both boxes side-by-side. In an attempt to do that, you add a
width of 80% to the blue paragraph. What happens? How can you fix this problem
without changing the width setting?

It is too wide to fit inline with the floated div. I added the `box-sizing:
border-box;` line to make it fit
