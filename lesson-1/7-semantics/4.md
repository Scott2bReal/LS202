Given the following HTML, would `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<article>`, or `<div>`
be the most appropriate element for the tag shown as `<sometag>`?

```html 
<sometag>
  <h3>Text-align Property</h3>
  <p>
    Given the width of the paragraph, the heading looks odd hanging out on
    the left side of the screen. Let's center it instead; we'll do this
    with the text-align property:
  <p>

  <pre>
    <h1 style="color: orange; text-align: center;">Hello, Internet!</h1>
  </pre>
</sometag>
```

I think section would be the best
