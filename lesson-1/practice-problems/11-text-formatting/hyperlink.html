      The Creating Hyperlinks section of <a
        href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/getting-to-know-html/#creating-hyperlinks">Getting
        to Know HTML</a> discusses hyperlinks, or anchors. Be sure to work both
      "In Practice" sections; they pick up from where you left off in an
      earlier reading assignment.
